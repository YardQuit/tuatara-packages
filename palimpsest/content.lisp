;;;; palimpsest/content.lisp --- A PDF's pages and what each draws: text, filled shapes and pictures, with where.

;;;;
;;;; Each page of a revision is read from its page tree, what it inherits
;;;; with it, and its content streams are read as the operators they hold:
;;;; the text each shows (its characters by the font's ToUnicode map, else
;;;; its encoding, else the codes themselves in hex), in which font, size,
;;;; colour and render mode, and where on the page; each shape filled and
;;;; each picture placed, with its box. What a page draws in one revision is
;;;; then set beside what it drew in the revision before. Nothing is drawn:
;;;; the operators are only followed, each page and all pages together held
;;;; to a count of them.
