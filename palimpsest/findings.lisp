;;;; palimpsest/findings.lisp --- The signs of a PDF's editing, each with its evidence and how to see it by hand.
;;;; Copyright (C) 2026 Michael A Jones.  GPL-3.0-or-later; see LICENSE.
;;;;
;;;; Each check looks for one kind of sign that examiners of documents know:
;;;; in how the file is put together, in what it says of itself, in what its
;;;; pages draw, in its pictures, annotations, form and signatures. A sign
;;;; found is a FINDING: how strong a sign it is, one plain sentence of what
;;;; it means, the revision, page and objects it is in, the rule that found
;;;; it, the evidence (offsets and the octets themselves, in hex and as text)
;;;; and the steps that show it again with a hex editor alone. A check that
;;;; cannot finish on a malformed file says so as a finding of its own.
