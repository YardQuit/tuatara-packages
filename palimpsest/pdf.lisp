;;;; palimpsest/pdf.lisp --- A PDF read from its octets alone: its saves, cross-reference sections, objects and streams.
;;;; Copyright (C) 2026 Michael A Jones.  GPL-3.0-or-later; see LICENSE.
;;;;
;;;; A PDF changed after it was made keeps what it was: each save appends the
;;;; objects it changes, a cross-reference section saying where they are, a
;;;; trailer pointing back to the section before, and an %%EOF line. Here the
;;;; file is read once, whole, as octets: every object written in it found by
;;;; scanning its body, every save (revision) found by its %%EOF and read by
;;;; its cross-reference section (a table, a stream, or both), and the
;;;; objects each revision holds told apart from those of the revision before.
;;;; Objects and their streams are read by Tuatara's PDF reader (Flate, LZW,
;;;; ASCII hex and 85, run length, with their predictors), each stream held
;;;; to a size; the data of pictures is never decoded. Nothing in the file
;;;; is run, and the file is never written: whatever it holds that does not
;;;; make sense is noted, never an error.
